               <a href="https://logosnews.tech/" target="_blank">Logos</a> is a decentralized news platform for the new age of digital media. <br><br>
               I came onto the Logos design team to enhace the user experience of the main news feed. The CEO was looking for our team to conduct a complete redesign of the site. This involved building a new style guide for the site to use for our individual designs.

         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>After being onboarded with Logos and the design team, the challenge statement became evident: <br><br>
            	<span style="font-size:22px;font-weight:600;font-style:italic;">How can we implement Logos' mission to make news transparent for readers while holding user's perception of news on the web in tact?</span>

            <h3>Previous Research and Designs</h3>
            <p>Before coming on for the homepage redesign, I was given previous research and a live design of the site to work with. <br><br>

               From its inception, Logos has wanted to integrate elements of Facebook's home page layout into their own main feed. It's undeniable that Facebook has the ability to set trends. Below is a wireframe of the three section layout for Facebook's home page.
            </p>

               <div id="content_pic">
                  <a>
                     <img src="fbhomepage.png">
                  </a> 
                  <!-- <p></p> --> 
               </div>

               <p>Below is the old Logos site, which integrates the middle and right portions of Facebook's home page, but needs the left portion of the site integrated.</p>

               <div id="content_pic">
                  <a>
                     <img src="oldlogos.png" style="max-width: 75%;">
                  </a> 
                  <p>Logo's old homepage</p> 
               </div>
               <p>I was directed to keep the following elements in my redesign:
               	<ol>
                     <li>  The Header with Search Bar and Icons</li>
                     <li>  The Subscriptions Section </li>
                     <li>  The Suggested People Section</li>
                   </ol>
               </p>
                <div id="content_pic">
                  <a>
                     <img src="operation.png" style="max-width: 75%;">
                  </a> 
                  <p>Logo's old homepage</p> 
               </div>
               <p>The main changes that will be implemented to align with Facebook's homepage is: 
                  <ol>
                     <li>  Add left portion: The Navigation Bar</li>
                     <li>  Create article sections </li>
                     <li>  Restructure article cards</li>
                   </ol>
               </p>

         <div class = "content_statement">
            <h3>My Research</h3>
         	<p>I looked into the top 10 web app news sources (<a href="https://www.agilitypr.com/resources/top-media-outlets/top-10-daily-american-newspapers/">source</a>). Here are some quick notes on the common themes and patterns across these sites: </p>
         	<p>
         		8 out of the 10 sites had a navigation bar with different sections (sports,business, etc.) <br><br>

         		Borders are dictated by margins, margin lines. If you zoom in, you can see light gray lines creating space for the articles and sections, but the lines that are perpendicular to each other never touch. The articles seem to be their own entities, but the sites display a level of cohesiveness in their proximity. You will also notice there is a mix of sizing and positioning with articles, especially with the featured section of news publications. Some are horizontal and some are vertical. <br><br>

         		<div id="content_pic">
            		<a>
            			<img src="news_research.png">
            		</a> 
            		<!-- <p>Wickens, T. D. (2002). Elementary signal detection theory. Oxford University Press. Page 13</p> -->
         		</div>
			      <p>
            		In terms of components of article “tiles”, the main three components of an article I found across the top websites are:
               </p>
            		 <ol>
            		 	<li>  Thumbnail</li>
            		 	<li>  Title</li>
            		 	<li>  Subheading (a sentence or two long)</li>

            		 </ol>
            	<p>
            		 As seen with the New York Times above, the featured article sections of most popular news sites are skeuomorphic in that they resemble a physical newspaper with an asymmetricallayout. For subsections of a site, it becomes a toss up between a symmetrical layout (typically with horizontal article tiles) and an asymmetrical layout.
