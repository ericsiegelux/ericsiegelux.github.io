  <h2>Project Overview and Research</h2>
  <div class = "content_statement">
  	<h4>Identifying the Problem</h4>
    <p>Families are not properly informed and prepared for surgeries. Medical professionals can provide some guidance to parents in navigating patient journeys, but are not always available to answer questions. Additionally, children are often left in the dark about the actual procedure, and as a result are less willing to cooperate with doctors and nurses.<br><br>

	<span style="font-style: italic;"> Main Question: How can we successfully guide both parents and patients through a surgical procedure? </span> <br><br>

	<h4>The Solution: The CHLA app</h4>
	<p>The CHLA (Children's Hospital Los Angeles) app is our solution to mitigating surgery cancellations and readmittance to hospitals. After a brief onboarding process, the CHLA app is divided into two sides: a parent side and child side. The parent side provides a timeline with chronologically ordered information to prepare a family for the surgery. The child side educates children on the surgery process with an interactive journey game.

	To highlight the need for an app like the CHLA app, we started with extensive research on surgeries in the United States and decided to focus our attention on tonsillectomies for the CHLA app prototype. 

	<h4>Why is this Project Important?</h4>

  <div id="content_pic">

	<p>In the United States, there are about 1.848 million hospital stays annually for children ages 0-17, excluding neonatal and maternal stays (<a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb187-Hospital-Stays-Children-2012.pdf">source</a>). With regard to tonsillectomy procedures, 500,000 cases are performed annually on children under 15 years of age (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536942/">source</a>), which accounts for 27% of the child hospital stays.<br><br>  

	Statistically, there are more recorded cases of procedures than children admitted to the hospital due to surgical readmissions. For tonsillectomies, about 3.6% of patients are readmitted, primarily due to dehydration (47%) and hemorrhage (26%) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29501287">source</a>). 3.6% seems insiginificant, but that is 18,000 children being readmitted. This is a problem for hospitals because it interferes with scheduled surgeries. Both of these causes are easily preventable if parents and patients are educated on the proper steps to recovery before the actual surgery. As a result, providing access to this information ahead of time will reduce surgical readmissions. </p>


	<h4>Research</h4>

    <p>
      My team had the opportunity to interview some healthcare professionals at Children's Hospital Los Angeles to see what their experience was with patients not being prepared for their surgery or last minute cancellations. <br><br>

      Below are three quotes from healthcare professionals at CHLA that further elaborated on the problems our app was trying to solve

    </div>

    <p>
      The major takeaways from these three quotes, and other interviews we conducted are:
        <ul>
          <li>Not knowing the right information to prepare for surgery</li>
          <li>A number of the cancellations are preventable</li>
          <li>The parents and children both need to be engaged in preparing for surgery</li>
        </ul>

  <h4>User Flow</h4>

  	<p style="font-weight: bold">Onboarding</p>
    <p>The first user flow I had to create was the onboarding user flow. The parents would set up the app to provide the proper information for their child's specific surgery and to toggle between the parent side and child side.

	<p style="font-weight: bold">Parent Side</p>
	<p>I was tasked with creating the user flow for the parent side of the CHLA app. I hashed out the idea of creating an interactive timeline with checklists and information so that parents could keep track of the surgery process and avoid going to Google for answers.</p>
