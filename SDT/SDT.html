  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class = "content_statement">
    <p style="margin: -30px 0px 0px 0px;">In Winter Quarter 2020, I was taking an undergraduate laboratory course for my cognitive science major called Psychology 186C: Psychophysical Theories and Methods.  <br><br>

    The course was taught by <a href="https://www.jasonsjournal.co/">Dr. Zili Liu</a>, a UCLA psychology professor who runs his own lab focusing on computational, psychophysical, and neuroimaging techniques in order to help understand the way in which our brains construct our reality. The emphasis of the class was on signal detection theory, which I will cover shortly. <br><br>

     A requirement for the course was to design an experiment that utilized signal detection theory. I worked with a fellow classmate, <a href="https://www.jasonsjournal.co/">Jason Kuang</a>, to create an experiment that was focused on our shared interest of UI Design and UX Design. </p>

  <h2>Signal Detection Theory <br> (In A Nutsell)</h2>

  <div class = "content_statement">
    <p>Signal Detection Theory (SDT) allows researchers to measure the abilities of people to detect a stimulus when presented among randomness or, as it is called in signal detection theory, noise. This broad definition allows for SDT to be applied to scenarios such as testing whether an x-ray is normal or abnormal or whether an earthquake is occurring or not. <br><br>

        <h4>Using Different Streaming Services</h4>
        <p> To start developing Musaic, Ram and I had to decide which music platform to focus on. Since we were only a two person team, Ram said he would only be able to develop Musaic with one streaming service's API in order to roll out Musaic in a reasonable time. I was biased because I have Apple Music, but I knew we needed to collect data on people's choices in streaming services. Below is a pie chart of 148 responses to "What Streaming Service Do You Use":</p>
