  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
    <p >In Winter Quarter 2020, I was taking an undergraduate laboratory course for my cognitive science major called Psychology 186C: Psychophysical Theories and Methods.  <br><br>

    The course was taught by <a href="https://www.jasonsjournal.co/">Dr. Zili Liu</a>, a UCLA psychology professor who runs his own lab focusing on computational, psychophysical, and neuroimaging techniques in order to help understand the way in which our brains construct our reality. The emphasis of the class was on signal detection theory, which I will cover shortly. <br><br>

     A requirement for the course was to design an experiment that utilized signal detection theory. I worked with a fellow classmate, <a href="https://www.jasonsjournal.co/">Jason Kuang</a>, to create an experiment that was focused on our shared interest of UI Design and UX Design. </p>

  <h2>Signal Detection Theory <br> (In A Nutsell)</h2>

  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding:0px 5%;">
    <p>Signal Detection Theory (SDT) allows researchers to measure the abilities of people to detect a stimulus when presented among randomness or, as it is called in signal detection theory, noise. This broad definition allows for SDT to be applied to scenarios such as testing whether an x-ray is normal or abnormal or whether an earthquake is occurring or not. <br><br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
    <h3>Key Measurements in SDT</h3>
    <p>All statstics that are used in signal detection theory come from four basic measurements:</p>

     <div id="vizandinstr" style="padding: 0px 5%">
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Hit</h4>
            <p>When a signal is present and the participant says the signal is present</p>
          </div>
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Miss</h4>
            <p>When a signal is present but the participant says the signal is not present</p>
          </div>
      </div>

      <div id="vizandinstr" style="padding: 0px 5%">
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Correct Rejection</h4>
            <p>When only noise is present and the participant says there is no signal</p>
          </div>
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">False Alarm</h4>
            <p>When only noise is present but the participant says the signal is present</p>
          </div>
      </div>

    <p>Below is a commonly used chart of the four key measurements in signal detection theory</p>

    <h3>Distributions of Signal and Noise</h3>
      <p>The analysis of a signal detection experiment relies on assuming a distribution of signal events and noise events. What this means is there are seperate probabilities of experiencing a signal event or a noise event. The distribution curves below are representative of theoretical noise and signal events. The higher the point on a distribution, the more likely it will occur.</p>

  </div>

  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
    <p>Now, when we overlay the signal distribution curve and the noise distribution curve, we see some overlap in the middle. This is where a participant is more likely to rely on guessing. <br><br>
    The funny little character on the x axis &#955; ,or lambda, is what we call our decision criteria. The decision criteria is established through data collection of a participant's hits, misses, correct rejections, and false alarms. It's placement on a graph like the one below tells researchers what a participant's typical response behavior is statistically.</p>

        <h4>Using Different Streaming Services</h4>
        <p> To start developing Musaic, Ram and I had to decide which music platform to focus on. Since we were only a two person team, Ram said he would only be able to develop Musaic with one streaming service's API in order to roll out Musaic in a reasonable time. I was biased because I have Apple Music, but I knew we needed to collect data on people's choices in streaming services. Below is a pie chart of 148 responses to "What Streaming Service Do You Use":</p>
