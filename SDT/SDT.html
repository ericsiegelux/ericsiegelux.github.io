        <h4>Using Different Streaming Services</h4>
        <p> To start developing Musaic, Ram and I had to decide which music platform to focus on. Since we were only a two person team, Ram said he would only be able to develop Musaic with one streaming service's API in order to roll out Musaic in a reasonable time. I was biased because I have Apple Music, but I knew we needed to collect data on people's choices in streaming services. Below is a pie chart of 148 responses to "What Streaming Service Do You Use":</p>
