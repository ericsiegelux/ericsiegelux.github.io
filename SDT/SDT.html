  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
    <p >In Winter Quarter 2020, I was taking an undergraduate laboratory course for my cognitive science major called Psychology 186C: Psychophysical Theories and Methods.  <br><br>

    The course was taught by <a href="https://www.jasonsjournal.co/">Dr. Zili Liu</a>, a UCLA psychology professor who runs his own lab focusing on computational, psychophysical, and neuroimaging techniques in order to help understand the way in which our brains construct our reality. The emphasis of the class was on signal detection theory, which I will cover shortly. <br><br>

     A requirement for the course was to design an experiment that utilized signal detection theory. I worked with a fellow classmate, <a href="https://www.jasonsjournal.co/">Jason Kuang</a>, to create an experiment that was focused on our shared interest of UI Design and UX Design. </p>

  <h2>Signal Detection Theory <br> (In A Nutsell)</h2>

  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding:0px 5%;">
    <p>Signal Detection Theory (SDT) allows researchers to measure the abilities of people to detect a stimulus when presented among randomness or, as it is called in signal detection theory, noise. This broad definition allows for SDT to be applied to scenarios such as testing whether an x-ray is normal or abnormal or whether an earthquake is occurring or not. <br><br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
    <h3>Key Measurements in SDT</h3>
    <p>All statstics that are used in signal detection theory come from four basic measurements:</p>

     <div id="vizandinstr" style="padding: 0px 5%">
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Hit</h4>
            <p>When a signal is present and the participant says the signal is present</p>
          </div>
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Miss</h4>
            <p>When a signal is present but the participant says the signal is not present</p>
          </div>
      </div>

      <div id="vizandinstr" style="padding: 0px 5%">
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Correct Rejection</h4>
            <p>When only noise is present and the participant says there is no signal</p>
          </div>
          <div id="instruction">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">False Alarm</h4>
            <p>When only noise is present but the participant says the signal is present</p>
          </div>
      </div>

    <p>Below is a commonly used chart of the four key measurements in signal detection theory</p>

    <h3>Distributions of Signal and Noise</h3>
      <p>The analysis of a signal detection experiment relies on assuming a distribution of signal events and noise events. What this means is there are seperate probabilities of experiencing a signal event or a noise event. The distribution curves below are representative of theoretical noise and signal events. The higher the point on a distribution, the more likely it will occur.</p>

  </div>

  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
    <p>Now, when we overlay the signal distribution curve and the noise distribution curve, we see some overlap in the middle. This is where a participant is more likely to rely on guessing. <br><br>
    The funny little character on the x axis &#955; ,or lambda, is what we call our decision criteria. The decision criteria is established through data collection of a participant's hits, misses, correct rejections, and false alarms. It's placement on a graph like the one below tells researchers what a participant's typical response behavior is statistically.</p>

  <h2>The idea</h2>
 
  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%" >
  	<p>Jason and I started to discuss how the ux design process relies on a scientific process before rolling out products, yet there seems to be differences across all websites and applications. This might sound like a silly statement because every website/application has a unique function and service, but look at the photos below. <br><br>
  	 </p>
   </div>

	<div id="content_pic">
	    <a href="pop_ui.png" target="_blank">

	  </div>

	  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%" >
	 	<p> The red ovals are circling the new post functionality, yet they are in different positions on the mobile screen. I pulled them from Facebook's, Instagram's, and the Note's application page on the app store, respectively. All of these example users are presented in portrait mode, not landscape mode. <br><br>  <br><br>

  		These findings into applications lead us to ask two questions that would form the foundation of our experiment:
  		<ol style="text-align: left;">
  			<li>Are users more sensitive to certain areas of mobile interfaces?</li>
  			<li>If users are sensitive to a certain area, is the area dependent of a mobile device being in landscape mode versus portrait mode?</li>
  		</ol>

  <h2>Literature Review on Visual Search</h2>
  <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
  	<p>
  		In explaining our discussions to Dr. Liu, he told Jason and I our experiment would involve the topic of Visual Search.
		Visual search is a type of perceptual task typically involving an active scan of a visual environment for a particular object or feature (signal) among other objects (noise). <br><br>
		A literature review on visual search and visual search experiments pertaining to mobile devices was our next step. Below is an example of a visual search experiment offered through software from the University of Indiana Bloomington.<br><br>
	</p>
</div>

	<div id="content_pic">
    	<a href="https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/CogSciSoftware/VisualSearch/" target="_blank">
      	<img src="vs_ex.png">
    	</a> 
   </div>
		
	<div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
	<p>
		A common theme appearing in our research of visual search on mobile devices was the F-shaped pattern for text scanning. The F-shaped pattern appears when a user scans the first row of text thoroughly and each subsequent row below is less thourghly examined. The F-shape arises in people whose language reads from left to right.<br><br>
	</p>
   </div>

   <div id="content_pic">
    <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/" target="_blank">
      <img src="fshape.png">
    </a> 
   </div>

  	 <div class = "content_statement" style="padding: 0px 5%">
  	 	<p>

  	 		The F-shape pattern was the key to forming our hypothesis:  <br><br>
  	 		<p style="font-style: italic;">Given typical web reading patterns, users are more sensitive to Quadrant 2 and 3 of a mobile interface, regardless of orientation.</p>
