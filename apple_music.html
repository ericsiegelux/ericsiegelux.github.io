            <p>
            Apple Music is a streaming service that allows users to listen to 70 million songs. Its main features include the ability to download tracks and play them offline, listening across devices, personalized music recommendations, and curated playlists from its editors. <br><br>

            What is sorely lacking in Apple Music is social features between users, which leads us to ask:<br><br>

            <span style="font-style: italic;font-size: 26px">What can be done to seamlessly integrate new social features into Apple Music?</span> <br><br>

            The key to this statement is the word <span style="font-style: italic">seamlessly</span>. Apple Music, as an extenstion of Apple, has some of the best designers in the world working for them, so there is no sense in creating a new style guide for this problem. <br><br>

            What will need to be done is utilizing existing features of elements in Apple Music and common social interaction features in Apple products to enhance a facet to an already great product.

         <h1>Why People Want To Share and Connect With Music</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>Music has an important role in our personal lives and our culture. We resonant with some music deeply and consider it a part of our identity. Now, research has been conducted to understand why we feel compelled to share this part of idenity with others. <br><br>

            Research has shown that people affiliate musical taste with holding certain values, and that this assumed connection between music and values influences how much we think we’ll like someone based on their musical tastes (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167211407521" target="_blank">source</a>). <br><br>

            There are also studies correlating social cohesion is higher within families and among peer groups when young people listen to music together. This effect points to music’s potential power to act as “social glue” between not just peers but families.(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4021113/" target="_blank">source</a>). <br><br>

            So while music may be a personal experience for some people, it begs the question as to why Apple Music and other streaming services haven't utlized their millions of user's profiles, massive music catalog, and nifty recommendation algorithms to promote social cohesion on their platform.

         <h1>What Apple Music Has So Far</h1>

         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>After a bit of a struggle to find my public Apple Music profile, these were the three social components on my profile and a friend's profile: </p>
            <div id="big_pic">
               <a>
                  <img src="apple_music/profile.png">
               </a>
            </div>
            <p>Consider me disappointed! The functionality to find friend's is at the bottom of the page. For this redesign, we will be placing the button in a more accessible position for users to take advanage of the new social functionalities. <br><br>   

             While the profile is a start, it becomes tedious to go through a friend's playlist and find songs you like. I know Apple Music keeps your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/musickit/" target="_blank">listening history</a> and a long with that attributes of songs to optimize recommendations for you. Apple Music can put this data to better use for you and your friends on the platform.</p>

         <h1>3 Ideas for Social Functionalities to a User's Profile Utilizing Data</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>I came up with three new realistic social functionalities for Apple Music:</p>

            <h4>1. Summary of Listening Habits</h4>
            <p>I came across the page below in my research for how Apple Music uses user's listening data and it gave me confidence to utilize this set up in a user's profile. It is Apple Music's Replay page, a summary of a user's listening habits for the year. For whatever reason, I could only acess it on a web browswer. <br><br>
            I highlighted the parts of the Replay page that I will incorporate into a user's Apple Music Profile. </p>
            <div id="big_pic">
               <a>
                  <img src="apple_music/replay.png">
               </a>
            </div>
            <p>My goal will be to "humanize" the data so that numbers and metrics do not scare users off.</p>

            <h4>2. Compatibility Scores</h4>
            <p>This one is tricky because I am going off of documentation from <a href="https://medium.com/@boplantinga/what-do-spotifys-audio-features-tell-us-about-this-year-s-eurovision-song-contest-66ad188e112a#:~:text=Spotify%20Audio%20Analysis&text=Danceability%3A%20Danceability%20describes%20how%20suitable,and%201.0%20is%20most%20danceable." target="_blank"> Spotify</a>. Spotify has audio analysis for every track on the streaming service. <br><br>
            Here are some of the track metrics that Spotify offers: </p>
            <div id="big_pic">
               <a>
                  <img src="apple_music/metrics.png">
               </a>
            </div>
            <p>From research about Apple and their developer tools, I came across an <a href="https://medium.com/@boplantinga/what-do-spotifys-audio-features-tell-us-about-this-year-s-eurovision-song-contest-66ad188e112a#:~:text=Spotify%20Audio%20Analysis&text=Danceability%3A%20Danceability%20describes%20how%20suitable,and%201.0%20is%20most%20danceable." target="_blank">Apple audio analysis tool</a> that leads me to believe Apple Music either has or is capable of providing the audio analysis features for tracks like Spotify does.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h4>3. Alogirthm Generated Collaborative Playlist</h4>
            <p>The last social functionality that I want to add is a solution to the problem of exploring your friend's music. The idea will be to allow a user to generate a playlist with a specific friend in mind. Apple Music will look at both profiles (the genres they listen too, new artists they may like, etc.) In addition to helping users navigate a person's playlist and musical taste, this functionality will also act as the social cohesion that I found in initial research about why we share music. <br><br>

            I was able to find third party websites that utilizd streaming services' APIs to create shared playlists. Here is a screenshort from a site called <a href="https://sametunes.com/index.php" target="_blank">Same Tunes</a> :
